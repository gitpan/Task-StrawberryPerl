NAME
    Task::StrawberryPerl - Specification for modules bundled with Strawberry
    Perl

DESCRIPTION
    Strawberry Perl is the second in a series of Win32 Perl distributions.

    It includes the Perl CORE, plus a defined set of additional modules with
    various minimum versions.

    This Task module represents the complete dependency specification for
    the Strawberry Perl distribution, and lists all dual and non-core
    modules that are part of the Strawberry Perl specification.

    As well as providing a basis for the build process to install the
    required modules, it also means that a distribution such as Vanilla Perl
    (the smaller core-only Win32 distribution from the same series) can be
    upgraded to something that meets the Strawberry Perl specification, and
    indeed response as if it was Strawberry Perl.

TODO
    The current specification is only preliminary and is being uploaded to
    CPAN for the purpose for testing the installation of the various
    modules, locating bugs, recording the current concensus on what will or
    will not be in the distribution "out of the box", and determining the
    optimum order of the dependencies (to minimize installation recursion
    when upgrading from Vanilla et al).
